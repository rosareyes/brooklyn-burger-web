Welcome to the GitHub repository of Brooklyn Burger Web, a UC3M university project for a UI/UX class. This webpage is designed with a focus on creating an accessible, usable, and engaging online presence for a fictional burger restaurant.

## Introduction

Brooklyn Burger Web is a demonstration of modern web development techniques, including HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. We strive to adhere to the best practices in web accessibility and usability to ensure a wide range of users can interact with our content effectively.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The website is crafted to look great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Accessibility-First Approach:** Implements ARIA roles and semantic HTML to support screen readers and assistive technologies.
- **Interactive Elements:** JavaScript-driven interactivity for dynamic content updates without reloading the page.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Tested on multiple web browsers for a consistent user experience.

## Setup

## Accessibility and Usability

This website design follows the principles of Universal Design, ensuring that our content is accessible to the broadest possible audience, including those with disabilities. Here are some of the key considerations we've implemented:

- **Keyboard Navigation:** The site can be fully navigated using a keyboard.
- **Contrast Ratios:** We've chosen color schemes that provide sufficient contrast between text and background colors.
- **Text Alternatives:** All non-text content has text alternatives that serve the equivalent purpose.
- **Predictable Layout:** The website maintains a consistent and predictable layout throughout.
- **Input Assistance:** Forms and input fields provide assistance, error messages, and clear labels.
